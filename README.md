### ðŸ‘‹Hi, I'm Jaydeep Chauhan

I'm a AI researcher and Machine Learning Engineer, I love solving real world problems using AI(actively participating in kaggle competitions) and I'm very passionate about understanding and visualizing ML algorithms. My long term goal is to create ML models which are robust, could able to learn from a very few samples, generalize under distribution shifts and can do high level reasoning about the world.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently doing a Masters Thesis on generalization under distributional shifts, disentanglement and causality in deep learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science from Indiana University Bloomington.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on research problems that I mentioned above.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for full time roles in ML Research scientist, CV/ML/NLP Engineer starting summer 2023.
- ðŸŽ¸ In my free time, you can find me playing riffs on guitar, excercising, reading fictions, cooking and watching F1/Cricket.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him/his.
